        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            It all began with a missing batch of cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            One moment, they were sitting there on the counter, golden, gooey, and perfect, like something straight out of a baking dream. The next? Gone. Vanished into thin air.
            Suspiciously, Yassine, had crumbs all over his face, but to this day, he swears he “has no idea what happened.”
        </p>
        <p>
            That was just another day in our chaotic, sugar-fueled friendship. We, Ranim, Mira, Rim, and Yassine, have always been the ones who showed up at every gathering with something sweet in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mira’s cakes? Oh, they were so perfect, we were convinced she had some secret deal with a pastry deity.
            Before slicing into them, people would hold passionate debates about whether it was morally acceptable to ruin such a masterpiece.
            Rim’s brownies had a mysterious way of vanishing before they even cooled, leaving us wondering if she’s secretly a magician, or, well,
            if Yassine has zero self-control.
            Ranim? She was always deep in some kind of experimental baking phase, like the time she swore spinach cupcakes were the future
            (spoiler: they were NOT).
            And Yassine, well, let’s just say he took his role as the official taste tester very seriously. (Maybe a little too seriously).
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, one day, as we all stood in the middle of yet another flour-covered kitchen disaster, Ranim had a thought:
            “Why keep experimenting in the dark when we could share our precious recipes with each other and get better together?”
        </p>
        <p>
            So, with all the encouragement and enthusiasm from the crew,
            we created this website, a little corner of the internet that smells like vanilla and cinnamon (and maybe a hint of chaos,
            if you smell closely), where flour-splattered beginners and frosting-obsessed experts could come together, swap recipes, and share the joy (and the inevitable disasters)
            of baking. This isn’t just a collection of recipes; it’s our love letter to every midnight cake craving, every failed pancake that somehow turned into an unexpected adventure,
            and every bite that left someone smiling and asking for more.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, welcome to our kitchen. Stay as long as you like,
            bake something messy, and if your cookies go missing... well, you know exactly who to blame.
